# This project is a part of the Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity. 
    The dataset consists of pre-labeled tweets and messages from real-life disaster events. 
    The goal of this project is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model capable of categorizing messages in real-time.
    The project is divided into these core sections:
    
    
    Data Processing: Building an ETL pipeline to extract data from the source, clean it, and store it in a SQLite database.
    Machine Learning Pipeline: Creating a pipeline to train a model that can classify text messages into various categories.
    Web Application: Deploying a web app to display model results in real-time.

*This Machine Learning model is basic trained but not perfect, this just shows the possibility of this project!*


# Getting Started

## Dependencies

    Python 3.11
    Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, sqlite3
    NLP Libraries: NLTK
    SQLite Libraries: SQLAlchemy
    Model Serialization: Pickle
    Web App & Data Visualization: Flask, Plotly


## Executing Program:

    Once u cloned the Folder u can simply follow this path:
    'Disaster_Response\app\run.py'
    
    once u started the python programm, u should be able to go to following adress and test the code.
    Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
